# Project KC House - Insights

### This project is an insight study based on public real estate data from KC House provided by Kaggle. The project is not intended to propose solutions for the company, being only an object of demonstration of analytical skills.


KC is a real estate sales company where its profit is in the arbitrage of the purchase, that is, 
in buying real estate for a value 'x' and selling it later for a higher value. However, the CEO had 
a question, given a portfolio of properties, from which they should be purchased and, once purchased, 
when should the sale be carried out in order to guarantee a profit.
